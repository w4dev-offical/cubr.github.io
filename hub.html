    Cubr Hub
  </h1>
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <h3>What is hub?</h3>
  <p>It's a cubr "forum" for "talking" with w4dev and another players, so this this is a like portal</p>
  <h3>What is Minecraft cubr edition?</h3>
  <p>It's all really a complete fake that was made on YouTube for the sake of popularity, because apart from this site nothing related to Cubr exists.</p>
  <h3>Cubr is Minecraft copy?</h3>
  <p>Half the game will be on the edge and mostly will be w4dev ideas that at most other people have not brought to a proper release</p>
  <h3>w4dev is a single developer of cubr?</h3>
  <p>It is possible that I will have testers, because even one person has already emailed me something like “Hi, I know about your idea and it is awesome, I can be a tester”, if he agrees then maybe he will become a developer. Honestly I don't know where he got all this information from including my email and by the way the tester is ZoZVoE</p>
  <h3>Who is Uidie2?</h3>
  <p>This is both the first person to learn about Cubr and the first person to visit this site, is a friend of w4dev(me). Uidie2 is not a developer but there is a small percentage that he will become a tester</p>

    <h3>Mods on Cubr!?</h3>
    <p>I want the largest version to be 1.2 and it is called Content update in which you can make your own mod or download mods from other players and maybe even that later here (cubr hub) will be able to download these mods.</p>
